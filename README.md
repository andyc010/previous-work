Repository of code similar to what I have worked on in various positions.

Added files from a WinForms app done in Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition.

These files are similar to a prototype app I did for my current (05/2017) position using C#. It is a program that guides a tester through checking a PC, similar to the version I did at work to check products made by my company.

Side note: Another company employee used a portion of my code and incorporated his code to make a even better working version of the program. I also played a part in making changes to mostly the UI portions to this evolving program.
